*Goal of the Interim: get feedback, discuss freely beyond agenda items, make new ideas emerge.*
The agenda below can be updated when starting the meeting, according to the participants suggestions.

# New work items for the group

## IETF103 Hackathon (20')

(Vincent)
Goals and set up of the hackathon.
This item is in fact closely related to the Generic FEC API I-D.


## FEC and NC performance evaluation (20')

(Vincent)
Idea is to have a common benchmarking framework (cf. IETF102 meeting minutes). It may consider:

- Metrics
- Methodology
- Communication channels considered
- Tools


## Facilitating FEC and Network Coding adoption (40')

### FEC and NC for dummies

Goal is to give very simple hints on how FEC/NC may work and their potential.
It follows IETF102 comment (see meeting minutes):

> "99% of people using TCP don't know how it works but think the opposite. We need a "network coding for dummies" document.
> It's really important to have people think they understand how NC works for them to adopt the technology."


### FEC/NC and Congestion Control

(Marie-Jose)
Goal is to explain why FEC/NC can be CC friendly. An I-D that explains why would be appreciated.
What can we do, what are the main arguments?


## Additional topics (10')

(Marie-Jose)


# Progress on existing I-Ds (10' or more depending on authors)

[https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/nwcrg/documents/]
Any news? Authors please...

- (RG-Item I-D) NC for CCN/NDN: requirements and challenges

- (RG-Item I-D) NC and satellites

- RLNC I-D (expired)

- Generic FEC API for sliding window codes. See Hackathon item.

- FEC for QUIC (the two I-Ds)

- New I-D to be submitted for IETF103: BATS code, something else?


# About our NWCRG group

## A Github repo for the group (20') 

(Vincent)
Another, more open manner to work together.
